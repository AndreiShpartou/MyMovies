A modern, customizable iOS movie app built with UIKit, following VIPER architecture, integrating Firebase Authentication, Firestore, CoreData, and Cloudinary for profile image uploads.
This app allows users to browse movies, manage a wishlist, view details, edit profile information, and securely sign up or log in â€” while ensuring smooth and consistent data syncing through Firestore listeners and CoreData local persistence.
